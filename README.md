# WalkingCity

WalkingCity is the first reward-based walking community based off  Miami, FL. You could now improve the city’s sustainability through each walk you take, obtain rewards such as redeemable discounts, coupons or gifts that could be exchanged in local businesses. By joining the walking community, you will save a significantly amount of money in gas, support the local environment and economy, while getting rewarded for it.  It’s very simple!
